# Variables and Data Types in Python

In Python, variables are used to store data, and the data has different types. Let's explore variables and data types in Python.

## Variables

A variable is a named location in memory used to store data. To declare a variable, you simply assign a value to it.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30


In the example above, we have declared two variables: name and age.
Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

* Integer (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 5, -10, 100.
* Float (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0.
* String (str): Text, enclosed in single or double quotes, e.g., "Hello", 'Python'.
* Boolean (bool): True or False values.
* List (list): Ordered collection of items.
* Tuple (tuple): Ordered, immutable collection of items.
* Dictionary (dict): Key-value pairs.
* Set (set): Unordered collection of unique items.

Example:

    ```python
    # Variables with different data types
    name = "Alice"
    age = 30
    is_student = True
    grades = [95, 89, 78]

In the example above, we've used different data types for variables: str, int, bool, and list.
