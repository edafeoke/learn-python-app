# Python "Hello, World!" Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple "Hello, World!" Python program and explain each step along the way.

## Step 1: Creating a Python File

To get started, open your favorite code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or a plain text editor) and create a new file. You can name it `hello_world.py`. Make sure it has the `.py` extension, which indicates that it's a Python file.

## Step 2: Writing the Python Code

In your `hello_world.py` file, write the following Python code:

```python
# This is a Python comment. Comments are not executed by Python.
# They are used for adding explanations or notes to your code.

# The following line of code prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
# The `print` function is used to display output.
# The text "Hello, World!" is enclosed in double quotes (or single quotes),
# indicating a string literal.
print("Hello, World!")
